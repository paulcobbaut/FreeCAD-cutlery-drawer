### FreeCAD-cutlery-drawer
Playing with Python and FreeCAD to create a 3D printed cutlery drawer that holds the famous Tide cutlery.

This cutlery could be collected in the 50-ies and 60-ies in Europe (when buying Tide powder for laundry). 

### Goal
The goal is to 3D print a cutlery drawer.

Idea is to create an object that fills the drawer and then cut out the holes that
contain all the items. So the objects created in this script will be substracted
from the drawer space.

### Tide cutlery
This tableware consists of:
4 sizes forks:  14-15-18-20cm
4 sizes knives: 16-18-21-24cm
4 sizes spoons: 13-15-18-21cm
11 special items
